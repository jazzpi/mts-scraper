# MTS Scraper

This is a scraper for the *Modultransfersystem* of TUB's *MOSES* system.

Since the *MTS* uses [PrimeFaces](https://www.primefaces.org), which is really
annoying to reverse engineer, this scraper uses Selenium to do the requests.

## Installation

TODO

## Running

``` sh
python -m mts_scraper -h
```
